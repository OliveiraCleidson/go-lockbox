# go-lockbox (Work in Progress)

## About the Project

**go-lockbox** is a package under development that provides a unified interface for distributed locking operations, with initial support for **PostgreSQL** and plans for expansion to multiple backends (such as **Redis**, **etcd**, and others).

This system abstracts distributed locking operations, enabling secure and efficient control of shared resources in distributed environments.

### Key Features

- **Atomic Lock Acquisition**: Performs atomic lock acquisition, ensuring that multiple processes do not acquire the same resource simultaneously.
- **Secure Renewal with Ownership Verification**: Allows lock renewal while verifying the ownership of the process holding the lock.
- **Time-to-Live (TTL) Control**: Defines an expiration time for locks, preventing locks from staying indefinitely.
- **Health Monitoring**: Tools for monitoring the health of the distributed locking system.
- **Integrated Metrics**: Collects important metrics regarding the use of the locking system.

### Common Use Cases

- **Distributed Process Coordination**: Enables coordination between multiple processes in distributed systems.
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Prevents multiple processes from accessing a shared resource simultaneously.
- **Shared Resource Access Control**: Manages concurrent access to resources to ensure integrity and consistency.
- **Implementation of Distributed Queues**: Supports the creation of distributed task queues using locks.

## Work in Progress

Currently, **go-lockbox** is still under development. Some features are being implemented, and the architecture is being adjusted to support new storage backends and features. The initial package supports **PostgreSQL** for lock management, but the goal is to expand to other systems in the future.

If you're interested in contributing or testing the in-progress features, feel free to open **issues** or **pull requests**!
